"""Small SQLite helpers. Every component owns one connection in autocommit mode
and opens explicit ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transactions for writes.

A component instance may be shared between threads: every write transaction
and every read goes through the connection's re-entrant ``guard_lock``, so
statements of different threads never interleave inside one transaction.
Across processes, SQLite's own file locking serialises writers.

This is the package's own copy (joons_allocator must import nothing from
joons_agent_guard).
